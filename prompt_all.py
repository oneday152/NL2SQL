Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided.

Instructions:
1. Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

2. Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

3. List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single list. This list should contain:
   - Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
   - Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
   Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

4. Output Format: Return the keywords and keyphrases as a Python list. For example:
   ["keyword1", "keyphrase1", "keyword2", "keyphrase2"]

Answer:
Let's think step by step:
### **Step 1: Understand the Question and Hint**  
- **Question:** We need to find:  
  1. The senior engineers in tech companies in San Francisco.  
  2. The average salary of senior engineers.  
  3. The department distribution of these engineers.  
- **Hint:** Look for data related to:  
  1. Job titles (to identify "senior engineers").  
  2. Company location (to restrict to "San Francisco").  
  3. Department information (for department distribution).  
  4. Salary data (to calculate the average salary).  

---

### **Step 2: Examine Available Tables and Columns**  
From **FILTER TABLE**, the provided tables and columns are:  
1. **employees:**  
   - `title` (to identify "senior engineers").  
   - `salary` (to calculate the average salary).  
   - `dept_id` (to link employees to departments).  

2. **departments:**  
   - `company_id`: (to link departments to companies).  
   - `dept_id` (to link employees to departments).  
   - `name` (to get the names of departments).  

3. **companies:**  
   - `id` (to link departments to companies).  
   - `city` (to filter companies in "San Francisco").  
   - `industry` (to filter companies in the "Technology" industry).  
   - `name` (for potential company-level filtering, if required).  

There is no need to use the table `companies_info_additional` because the question is about senior engineers in tech companies in San Francisco, not about all companies.

---

### **Step 3: Use Column Descriptions to Verify Relevance**  
Using **COLUMN DESCRIPTION**,
The columns that are related to link tables are important:  

1. **From employees:**  
   - `title`: Includes "Senior Software Engineer," which matches our "senior engineers" filter.  
   - `salary`: Contains salary amounts needed for average calculation.  
   - `dept_id`: Matches table `departments` through `dept_id` to retrieve department information.  

2. **From departments:**  
   - `company_id`: Matches table `companies` through `id` to retrieve company information.  
   - `dept_id`: Matches table `employees` through `dept_id` to retrieve employee information.  
   - `name`: Provides department names for distribution analysis.  

3. **From companies:**  
   - `id`: Matches table `departments` through `company_id` to retrieve department information.  
   - `city`: Filters companies in "San Francisco."  
   - `industry`: Identifies "Technology" companies. According to the EXAMPLE in COLUMN DESCRIPTION, 'tech companies' is a type not a name of company.

---

### **Step 4: Generate Output**  
OUTPUT:
```json
{'employees': ['title', 'salary', 'dept_id'], 'departments': ['company_id', 'dept_id', 'name'], 'companies': ['id', 'city', 'industry']}
```

Instructions  
### Instructions for Writing SQL Queries

#### 1. **Understand the Question and Hint:**  
   - Carefully analyze the `Question` and `Hint` to fully understand the requirements.  
   - Pay close attention to details such as logic, columns, and conditions.  

---

#### 2. **Use Column Descriptions to Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**  
   - Cross-reference the `filter table-column` section with the `column description`.  
   - Select only the necessary tables and columns required to answer the question.  

---

#### 3. **Analyze and Expand the SQL Skeleton:**  
   - Use the provided `SQL SKELETON` keywords to construct the query, ensuring alignment with the question's requirements.  
   - If the keywords are insufficient, add appropriate SQL constructs.  

---

#### 4. **Simplification and Optimization SQL query**:  
   - Simplify sql without changing its original meaning
   - When there are too many subqueries and nesting is too complicated, use the JOIN clause to simplify the query.
   - ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is preferred to MAX()/MIN()

---

#### 5. **Step-by-Step Thinking Process:**  
   - Break down the problem into smaller sub-questions and address them individually.  
   - Use pseudo-SQL to outline your approach for each sub-question.  

---

#### 6. **Provide the Final SQL Query:**  
   - Present the fully assembled SQL query in an optimized form.  
   - Format it as follows:  
     FINAL SQL:
     SELECT ... 
     FROM ... ;

################################################################################################################################################################################################
1. Divide and Conquer:

   Main Question:
   What is the gender of the youngest client who opened an account in the lowest average salary branch?
   
   Analysis:
   The question asks about ‘gender’, which appears in the ‘client’ table. We will select this as the output column from the youngest client in the branch with the lowest average salary.
   
   Pseudo SQL:
   SELECT T1.gender 
   FROM client AS T1 
   WHERE youngest client in the lowest average salary branch;
   
   Sub-question 1: 
   Youngest client in the lowest average salary branch
   
   Analysis:
   To find the youngest client, use ‘A11’ from ‘district’ to get salary info, and ‘birth_date’ from ‘client’ to determine age. These tables can be INNER JOINed using "district id".
   
   Pseudo SQL:
   SELECT T1."client id" 
   FROM client AS T1 
   INNER JOIN district AS T2 ON T1."district id" = T2."district id" 
   WHERE lowest average salary branch 
   ORDER BY T1.birth_date DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1;
   
   Sub-question 1.1:
   Lowest average salary branch
   
   Analysis:
   Obtain the lowest average salary branch by ordering by ‘A11’ ASC and selecting the top 1. Since ‘A11’ is not NULLABLE, no "IS NOT NULL" filter is needed.
   
   Pseudo SQL:
   SELECT "district id" 
   FROM district 
   ORDER BY A11 ASC LIMIT 1;

2. Assembling SQL:

   Sub-question 1.1 (lowest average salary branch):
   SQL:
   SELECT "district id" 
   FROM district 
   ORDER BY A11 ASC LIMIT 1;

   Sub-question 1 (youngest client in the lowest average salary branch):
   SQL:
   SELECT T1."client id" 
   FROM client AS T1 
   INNER JOIN district AS T2 ON T1."district id" = T2."district id" 
   WHERE T2."district id" IN (SELECT "district id" FROM district ORDER BY A11 ASC LIMIT 1) 
   ORDER BY T1.birth_date DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1;

   Main Question (gender of the client):
   SQL:
   SELECT T1.gender 
   FROM client AS T1 
   WHERE T1."client id" = 
   (SELECT T1."client id" 
    FROM client AS T1 
    INNER JOIN district AS T2 ON T1."district id" = T2."district id" 
    WHERE T2."district id" IN (SELECT "district id" FROM district ORDER BY A11 ASC LIMIT 1) 
    ORDER BY T1.birth_date DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1);

3. Simplification and Optimization:

   Analysis:
   The nested queries can be combined using a single INNER JOIN to simplify and the filtering can be done within a single ORDER BY clause.
   We utilize ‘JOIN’, ‘ON’, ‘ORDER BY’, ‘DESC’, ‘LIMIT’ from the SQL skeleton to form the final optimized SQL query. Note that ‘WHERE’ is not mandatory in SQL skeleton, and ‘ASC’ and ‘NULLS LAST’ are used to sort clients by birth date in descending order.
   
   Optimized SQL Query:
   SELECT T1.gender 
   FROM client AS T1 
   INNER JOIN district AS T2 ON T1."district id" = T2."district id"
